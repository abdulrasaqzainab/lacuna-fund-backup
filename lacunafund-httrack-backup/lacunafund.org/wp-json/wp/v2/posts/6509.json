Over the past 10 years, the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge has provided open and accessible high quality labeled MRI images for development of ML tumor segmentation models and benchmarking of model performance. However, it is unclear how these methods translate in low-resourced regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where glioma mortality rates are the highest and the sustained use of less advanced MRI technology coupled with limited skilled personnel make glioma diagnosis challenging. The Africa-BraTS database pooled from existing patient data will provide a novel way of benchmarking performance of ML models in providing solutions to real world imaging challenges from low-resourced settings. In the end, this will influence how well brain tumors are delineated, measured, and characterized and long-term patient survival.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our primary aim is to solve challenges that reinforce disparities in application of ML in image-based diagnosis in lower-resourced settings, focusing on challenges unique to Sub Saharan Africa.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Udunna Anazodo, Montreal Neurological Institute, Chair, Consortium for Advancement of MRI Education and Research in Africa (CAMERA)<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-6523 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-300x174.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"174\" srcset=\"https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-300x174.png 300w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-1024x595.png 1024w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-768x446.png 768w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-1536x892.png 1536w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-2048x1189.png 2048w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-1920x1115.png 1920w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-1280x743.png 1280w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-640x372.png 640w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-810x470.png 810w, https:\/\/lacunafund.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2022\/05\/Lagos-Brats-Process-SKetch2-160x93.png 160w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>\n<h5><\/h5>\n<h5><b>Machine Learning from Real Patient Outcomes to Reduce Racial Disparities in Chronic Pain<\/b><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This project will build a new, large imaging dataset linked to rich, real patient outcomes, including their pain scores\u2014helping to address underlying pain for underserved populations. By training an algorithm to look at knee X-rays and predict pain that patients report feeling, rather than a doctor\u2019s score of the X-ray, the project team has unlocked medical insights that have been able to better detect causes of knee pain in Black patients. However, the challenge to scaling this approach is that existing datasets are insufficient, as they routinely contain just the knee X-ray and the doctor\u2019s judgment of it. Using this new method, the team will use the unique advantages of AI to sidestep biases inherent in old ways of reading X-rays, and instead produce new knowledge complementary to that of the doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h5>Chest X-Ray Imaging Dataset for Multiple Cardiorespiratory Diseases<\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardiorespiratory diseases are recognized as serious, worldwide public health concerns that have remained among the leading causes of death globally.
