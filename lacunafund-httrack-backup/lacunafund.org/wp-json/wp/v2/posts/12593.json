This dataset includes observations of about 17 diseases collected through field visits to the Philippines Department of Health (DOH) and the Philippine Statistical Authority (PSA). Another component of this dataset is \u201cOpen Buildings,\u201d which also functions as a standalone dataset that the team created containing 12,000 building outlines that show neighborhood densities, terrains, and levels of urbanization, as well as areas not yet mapped in OpenStreetMap.

Another barrier to accessibility and availability is the scarcity of digitized data at the community level due to the lack of staff training and budget constraints. By assembling Project CCHAIN, an open, analysis-ready dataset, we alleviate the burden on users who would otherwise need to manage significant data logistics and multidisciplinary expertise to gather and process data from various sources, formats, and geographic specifications. Focusing on the village or \u201cbarangay,\u201d the smallest administrative unit in the Philippines, also helps disaggregate health risks for vulnerable communities, particularly those in informal settlements, and provides actionable insights for local governments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Authors and Affiliations: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Thinking Machines Data Science, Inc.:<\/strong> Patricia Anne Faustino, JC Albert Peralta, Veronica Marie Araneta, Dafrose Camille Bajaro, Abigail Moreno<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span><strong>Epimetrics, Inc.:<\/strong> John Q.

The localized dataset is crucial in air quality monitoring and prediction, as well as accurate modeling of the air quality index for early warning signals and modeling of health risk. The data was obtained from abattoir centers in Southern Nigeria. The team collected data from representative samples of various states (i.e., Anambra, Enugu, Abia, Imo, Ebonyi, and Delta) within the research area. The team visited 27 stations and conducted on-site investigations, collecting over 200,000 numerical values of particulate matter (PM) concentrations using 10 air quality sensors for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10. Additionally, aerial view images were captured using a drone at varying heights (10m, 20m, 30m) during operational hours; the images will be trained with satellite imagery for the prediction of PM values.<\/p>\n<p>A preliminary survey indicates that abattoir centers in developing countries rely heavily on wood and sometimes discarded tires for meat processing. The use of these items for meat processing releases a significant amount of gaseous pollutants. Thick smoke is seen in the morning hours around these abattoirs as the meat processing takes place. Smoke from wood burning, coupled with minimal air movement from wind, can lead to elevated particle concentrations in abattoirs. Exposure to particulate matter and black carbon released in abattoirs has detrimental health outcomes with elevated morbidity and mortality, as shown by previous studies.
