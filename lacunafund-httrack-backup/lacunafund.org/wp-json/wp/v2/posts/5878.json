In this part of Africa, the majority of livestock are raised in traditional systems that rely on the sharing of communal resource areas, such as pastures and water.<\/p>\n<p>This project, which is led by The Nelson-Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology, University of Glasgow, University of Hohenheim, and NOTTECH Company Limited, will apply participatory methods and telemetry data to generate labeled datasets of landscape features. These labeled datasets will then be used to develop a community-led land use plan in Tanzania to support the management of livestock resources and reduce conflicts with crop cultivation.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Land use management and resource sharing is very vital in land based economies. This becomes even more apparent where livestock are a major part of the crop-livestock mixed systems. We are very excited and optimistic to contribute to the land use planning process through a data-driven and evidence-based tool.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>The Nelson-Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology<\/em><\/p>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/s31207.pcdn.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2021\/01\/NM-AIST-Logo1.jpg\" width=\"146\" height=\"143\" \/>\n<h5>Eyes on the Ground: Providing Quality Model Training Data through Smartphones<\/h5>\n<p>In the Eyes on the Ground project, the team from ACRE Africa and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) will use smartphones to create a unique dataset of georeferenced crop images along with labels on input use, crop management, phenology, crop damage, and yields. Images will be collected in 11 counties in Kenya. Funding will be used to support data collection, standardization of methods for submitting images, and curation of datasets so they meet best practices for ground reference data collection and cataloguing, while safeguarding ethics considerations.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/s31207.pcdn.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/11\/2021\/01\/ACRE-Farmer-in-Tharaka-Nithi-County-demonstrating-how-to-take-pcitures-with-the-smart-phone-002-810x608.jpeg\" width=\"281\" height=\"211\" \/>This is a novel concept that endeavors to provide smallholder farmers with risk mitigation and adaptation strategies through satellites and smart phones to ensure that they invest in high productivity agriculture investments. The ground pictures not only provide ACRE Africa with Eyes on the Ground to fine-tune insurance products\/models and minimize basis risk, but also enable us to observe management practices that promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing yet resilient technologies through bundling with stress-tolerant seeds and remote advisories. To bridge the gap between insurance products, resilient technologies and smallholder farmers we leverage on the Village Extension Service Providers (VESPs) model, a high touch and robust route to market model to help create awareness, capacitate and distribute our products.

This project is a collaborative initiative between the University of Maryland\/NASA Harvest Africa Program, The Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM), Center for Earth Observation and Citizen Science at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, The Regional Center for Mapping of Resource for Development (RCMRD), The Eastern Africa Grain Council (EAGC), Lutheran World Relief Mali, International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and Radiant Earth Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>Collectively, the team will use novel and innovative approaches that include rapid point data collection with cameras mounted on the hoods of vehicles\u2014\u201chelmets\u201d\u2014combined with crowdsourcing to create point and polygon labels. By partnering with local universities, this project will create opportunities for training future African researchers to use remote sensing and machine learning.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My favorite part of my work is to spend time in the field. There\u2019s so much to learn from the ground about the people, about the crops, and understanding why it is all-important. &#8220;Helmets Labeling Crops&#8221; is one of a kind opportunity to address a critical gap, to learn and develop a cost-effective scalable approach to labeled data needed to improve the basis of agricultural monitoring. We&#8217;ll also get a chance to train and work with students across Africa which is an exciting opportunity to encourage students into remote sensing, data science, and machine learning.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Catherine Lilian Nakalembe<\/em><br \/>\n<em>University of Maryland<\/em><\/p>\n<h5>IoT Water Quality Monitoring System for Freshwater Aquaponics Fish Ponds<\/h5>\n<p>Many in Sub-Saharan Africa live below the poverty line, leading to low protein intake. Aquaculture, the science of breeding fish for local protein consumption and commercial ventures, presents one solution. The University of Nigeria Nsukka will build a remotely monitored and controlled Internet of Things (IoT) water quality management system for conventional ponds and the\u00a0aquaponics fish pond systems to generate labeled datasets, and partner with local farmers to test the system in the field. These datasets will enable machine learning researchers to build models for predicting fish yield in terms of weight gain, water quality parameters, and feed consumption.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are excited and grateful to the Meridian Institute for offering us the opportunity through the Lacuna Fund to implement this project that we are passionate about in practical terms. We are hopeful it is going to open a vista of opportunities to local fish farmers as it will throw an avalanche of light into what happens inside the fish pond.

To address this, the\u00a0Locational Offset\u00a0Correction project will create a method for correcting location inaccuracies using available satellite data. This\u00a0method will then be used to create a new, clean version of a crop-cut yield dataset for maize crops in East Africa, which will be released along with a tool to allow others to re-create the process using additional datasets. This research will be conducted by a team from\u00a0Zindi\u00a0and the Big Data Platform of the CGIAR.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are looking forward to working with the Lacuna Fund to increase the representation of agriculture datasets in Africa. We will be calling on the amazing data science talent from across Africa and around the world to crowd-source a machine learning solution for correcting location errors, which are a common problem in agriculture datasets.
